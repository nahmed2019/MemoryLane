# MemoryLane
This repository has been created to submit my first project. This project is a maze game called MemoryLane.

# How to play:

The way you play this game is by placing the cursor on the start line and then the user has to navigate through the maze to the finish line. However, there is a catch to the game where if the user touches any of the walls, they will need to go back to the start line and navigate themselves through the maze all over again.

# Aim of the Game:

The aim of the game is to test the users patience, memory and their decision-making skills. The reason for this is that one wrong route will make the user to follow their trail back. On top of this, the user has to worry about the walls as touching one could lead them to go all the way back to the start line. 

# How it has been created:

The way this game was created is by using C# in a WPF application. I mainly used drag and drop for the structure of the maze such as the rectangles and the background colour. I assigned an event handler for the rectangles which will work in a way, where if the cursor touches any of the walls a message will pop-up and the player will need to go back to the start line. This event handler consisted of an IF statement.

# Problems faced and how I overcame the problem:
1.
2.

# Further improvements that can be made:
1. Add a Timer
2. Add lives which decreases everytime the cursor touches the wall.
3. Add an object that the user can use to naviagte through the maze.
